RGB is a protocol for asset tokenization through private contracts on **Bitcoin** and the **Lightning Network**. It employs a **client-side validation** architecture to maximize privacy, enhance scalability, and minimize the on-chain footprint.

This new Github organization continues the development of RGB v0.11.1, originally developed [here](https://github.com/RGB-WG) across v0.11.1 branches, in order to streamline contributions.
For more details on the reasons for this organizational change, see the
[motivations document](../MOTIVATIONS.md), while for more details on the
reasons to stick with the v0.11.1 rather than switching to the v0.12, see the
[v0.11.1 vs v0.12 document](../WHY_v0.11.1.md).
